# Text-data-from-images
This problem is from Dr.Reddy Hackathon. The objective is to rate and classify images based on the prescribed design principles. It is an exercise to convert these princiles into objective funtionas and rate the images.

The solution is still incomplete but it can be helpful if someone wants to exact textual data from an image and store it in an excel file.
